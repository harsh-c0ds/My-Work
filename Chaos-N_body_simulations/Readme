# My Work – Numerical Methods & Orbital Simulations

## Overview
This repository contains **numerical simulations of a three-body orbital system** using various integration schemes. The simulations study **orbital dynamics, energy conservation, angular momentum, and eccentricity evolution** for multiple bodies under Newtonian gravity.

Implemented in **Python** with **NumPy** and **Matplotlib**.

## Physics Context
We simulate a system of three bodies:  
1. Central massive body  
2. Two smaller orbiting bodies  

Key quantities computed:  
- Positions and velocities  
- Energy (kinetic + potential)  
- Angular momentum  
- Orbital elements: eccentricity `e` and semi-major axis `a`  

The code also explores **varying initial separations (`delta`)** and close encounters between bodies.
